# JavaLinkedListImplementation (SENG 265 - Assignment 3)

This project contains a custom implementation of a singly linked list in Java, created for Assignment 3 
of the SENG 265 course at the University of Victoria. The list supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.

## Features
- Add, remove, and retrieve elements by index
- Traverse and print list contents
- Reverse the linked list
- Fully tested with unit tests

## Files
- `A3LinkedList.java`: Linked list implementation
- `A3List.java`: List interface
- `A3Node.java`: Node class used internally by the list
- `A3Tester.java`: Unit tests for validating list functionality

## How to Run
```bash
javac *.java
java A3Tester
